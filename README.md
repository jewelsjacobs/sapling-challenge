# [Sapling Coding Challenge](docs/CHALLENGE.md)

## Includes:
> [Bacon-React-HTML](https://github.com/dirty-js/bacon.react.html) and [Bacon-Atom](https://github.com/dirty-js/bacon.atom),
> [React](https://baconjs.github.io/) library,
> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) / [Express](http://expressjs.com/) server
> and [Bacon.js](http://facebook.github.io/flux/) architecture (inspired by / ripped off from [React+Bacon.js TodoMVC](https://github.com/milankinen/react-bacon-todomvc)). Using
> [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) + [Watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify) with npm commands for quick build process setup,
> [Newforms-Bootstrap](https://github.com/insin/newforms-bootstrap) and the [React-Star-Rating](http://cameronjroe.com/react-star-rating/) components,
> [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) for the jsx and a few ES6 feature compilation, and
> [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/0.19.1/) which is a practical functional library for Javascript programmers - like lodash but immutable and more performant.
### Directory Layout

```

├── /node_modules/              # 3rd-party libraries and utilities
├── /src/                       # The source code of the application
│── package.json                # The list of 3rd party libraries and utilities
```

## TODO (If Time Allows)
 - BDD and TDD with cucumber.js + mocha (https://github.com/olivoil/NodeBDD)
